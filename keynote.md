> The most profound technologies are those that are woven into daily life - Mark Wieser
### Projects
#### GUI and non-sighted people
* When GUIs were first becoming popular, there was a movement to stop creating them because non-sighted people would not be able to use them
* Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was enacted in the United States to prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities but guidelines over digital accessibility were not in place
* Command line interfaces were much easier to convert to audio 
* Beth's team created a tool that could read what was on the screen
* She created a Braille UML type diagram to show the flow of the program for a blind man working for NASA that was reviewing her project -> "no one has put in this much effort"

**The technology was integrated into GUIs and improved the lives of non-sighted people**

#### Motion sensors for aging population
* A man wanted to keep an eye on his mother who lived far away
* They set up motion sensors in the house and the man had a portrait of his mother surrounded by a butterfly for each day of the month
* The butterfly changed size based on the motion of the day
* The man would call on unusual days to check in 

?: How did this technology make you feel? A: Less lonely, an invisible connection to her son

**The technology was integrated into her daily life and improved it**

#### Diabetes and technology
* After taking a diabetes course after being diagnosed with diabetes, the people would take a test but still not really understand
* The solution they came up with was to send a picture to the course director with any food/diabetes related questions they had

?: How do you perceive this technology? A: It was just talking to the course director

**The technology was integrated into their daily lives and improved them**

### Career Advice
1. Improve peoples' lives with technology
2. Well intended research can make things worse because it is unequally distributed
3. There is an inequality in access, uptake, and effectiveness of technology

> Designers need to analyze how the situations that frame design practice are themselves constructed -Suchman (paraphrased)
